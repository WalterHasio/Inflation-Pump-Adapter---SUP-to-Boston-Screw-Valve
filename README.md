Adapter for using a F-one / Naish / SUP style pump with a inflatable wing or kite using a screw-on boston valve.  I designed it to be used with a Takoon v1 2.5M wing and a F-one pump, but it will probably work with other products use the same valve type.  The adapter screws into the valve, and the pump hose connects to the adapter.
